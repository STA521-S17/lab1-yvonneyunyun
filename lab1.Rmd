##  Exercise 8 from ISLR Chapter 2

The following illustrate commands for exploring this exercise using R and various packages for the `Collage` data.

### Libraries

Try to load the `ISLR` library
```{r}
library(ISLR)
```


If it is not available you will need to install the  library from CRAN. Click on  *Packages*  then *Install*.  Enter the package name then click on the Install button.

You can also install from the console/command line using
`install.packages("ISLR")`.

Ready?

###  Getting the College data

Next we will need to load the dataset.  This is part of the library so we will not need to read it in using `read.csv` but rather we will use the `data` function to load it from the library.

```{r data}
data(College)
```

This loads the dataframe `College`.  Note you can always see the content of any `R` object by simply typing its name.

For information about the variables, read the text or enter
```{r}
help(College)
```

The info will appear in the `help` tab.

To see explore the data, you can use the command `View(College)`.

This will open a new tab, where you may scroll left and right to look at the rows and columns.
In the `View` you should see that the first column is the College/University name.  These can be extracted using `rownames(College)`.  Let's print out the first 5

```{r}
rownames(College)[1:5]
```



### Summary

```{r}
summary(College)
```
### Dimensions of Data

How many observations and variables are in the dataframe?


```{r dim, echo=FALSE}
d = dim(College)
```

Suppose we want to refer to those numbers in the text.  We can extract them using n = `r d[1]` and d = `r d[2]`.
Look at the code to see how we extracted them

### Scatter plot matrices

There `base` `R` version of scatter plot matrices is obtained using the `pairs` function to plot all variables versus each other.  We can use subsetting of columns of the dataframe to
look at the first 5 columns.  

```{r, fig.width=8}
pairs(College[, 1:5])
```

We can also look at this using the `ggpairs` function.
Install the library `GGally` if it is not available (and any dependent libraries) and load it.

```{r ggpairs, message=FALSE,warning=FALSE, fig.width=8}
library(GGally)
ggpairs(College, columns= c(1,3:5, 2))
```


_Energetic Students:  how do I suppress the message output so that it does not appear in my document ?  Post on Piazza if you know or make a pull request!_

The `ggpairs` function realizes that the variable `Private` is categorial and plots side by side histograms.  The density plots are also useful for seeing the skewness in the marginal distributions.

What other features do these plots indicate?  _(Think about assumptions for linear regression)_


### New variables

Let's create a new variable `Elite` by binning the `Top10perc` variable. We are going to divide universities into two groups based on whether or not the proportion of students coming from the top 10% of their high school classes exceeds 50 %.  We will use the library `dplyr` to illustrate some of the possible transformations and the idea of pipes, which are quite powerful once you get the hang of them!

```{r}
library(dplyr)
College = College %>% 
  mutate(Elite = factor(Top10perc > 50)) %>%
  mutate(Elite = 
           recode(Elite, 'TRUE' = "Yes", 'FALSE'="No"))
  
```


_What is the above doing?_    Document the code here.

Compare to the base `R` code:

```{r, evaluate=FALSE}
Elite=rep("No",nrow(College))
Elite[College$Top10perc > 50]="Yes"
Elite=as.factor(Elite)
college=data.frame(College ,Elite)
```

_How many Elite universities are there?_

```{r}
summary(College$Elite)
```

### Side by Side Boxplots

Let's plot the variable `Outstate` versus `Elite` using side-by-side boxplots.  Using `base R` we would enter

```{r, fig.width=6}
boxplot(Outstate ~ Elite, data=College, 
        ylab="Outstate", xlab="Elite")
title("Distribution of Out of State Tuition")
```
Now for the `ggplot` version:


```{r, fig.width=6}
library(ggplot2)
my.bp <<-ggplot(data=College, aes(y= Outstate, x=Elite)) # Creates boxplots
my.bp <- my.bp + geom_boxplot() # Adds color
my.bp <- my.bp + ggtitle("Distribution of Out of State Tuition") # Adds a title
my.bp <- my.bp +  ylab("Outstate") + xlab("Elite") # Adds lables for axes
my.bp # displays the boxplots
```


### Conditional Plots

Let's look at the distribution of Out of state tuition versus Elite status for Private versun Public universities using _conditional plots_

```{r, fig.width=8}
coplot(Outstate ~ Elite | Private, data=College)
```

_Energetic Student:  Please improve upone the above plot using ggplot and post to Piazza or issue a pull request_
